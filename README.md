# Chess Bot

### Note: This project is still in progress. Although you can now launch the board and make moves against yourself (on ubuntu after installing fltk), you cannot play against the bot yet. Promotion is also not yet implemented and trying to do so will break the game.

This is an app to play chess against a heuristic based AI opponent, written entirely in C++. On completion the executable should launch an interactive chess board on a new window, where you can make moves against the AI.  
As this is a personal project it is not intended to compete with the top engines nor will it be maintained or overly optimised.   
If you're looking for a high level open source chess engine, try https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish  
Although fun to program heuristic based AIs are also not the standard for serious chess engines, which instead are usually neural network based.   
Releases and instructions for those should come out shortly after every component of the project is implemented.
